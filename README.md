# Elderly Health Management Platform

## Overview

The Elderly Health Management Platform is a modern web application built with Vue 3 and Element Plus. It is designed to help elderly users and their caregivers manage health information, participate in community activities, consult with professionals, and maintain personal health records. The project strictly follows the business requirements (BR) for the A2 stage of the FIT5032 course, with a strong focus on usability, security, and extensibility.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Comprehensive Navigation:** Includes Health Info, Community Events, Online Consultation, Health Records, Medication Reminder, Community Forum, Caregiver Info, About Us, and more.
- **User Authentication:** Registration, login, and logout with localStorage-based user management.
- **Access Control:** Only authenticated users can access protected pages; unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
- **Form Validation & Security:** Robust client-side validation for all forms (username, password, role, etc.) to prevent invalid or malicious input. No direct HTML rendering from user input to prevent XSS.
- **Health Records Management:** Health data entry, data list display, and placeholders for data visualization and export.
- **User Experience:** Clean, modern UI with clear navigation, English prompts, and error feedback.
